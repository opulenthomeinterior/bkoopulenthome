                <h3 class="fw-bolder text-dark">What Legal Basis Do We Rely On To Process Your Information
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Data protection law sets out a number of conditions which organisations can rely on in order to
                    lawfully handle personal information. The conditions we rely on are as follows: –
                </p>

                <h4 class="fw-bolder text-dark">Legitimate Interests </h4>
                <p>
                    The law permits us to handle your personal information where necessary in our legitimate interests
                    provided that this isn’t outweighed by your interests. Many of the purposes we handle your personal
                    information, described above, fall into this category as they are essential activities which enable
                    us to run our business efficiently and effectively. For example, enabling us to use third party
                    service providers, to monitor, review and improve the services we provide to you and your experience
                    when you visit our Website and to help us ensure that we communicate with you about the things that
                    are most likely to be of interest to you. We may, if necessary, also use your information to defend
                    our legal rights or to obtain legal advice and to manage any complaint that you might have. We
                    ensure that your rights and interests are protected when we do this.
                </p>

                <h4 class="fw-bolder text-dark">Consent</h4>
                <p>
                    We are permitted to use your personal data when you give us your consent for us to do so. We will
                    only use your personal data to contact you for direct marketing purposes if you give us your consent
                    to do so.
                </p>

                <h4 class="fw-bolder text-dark">Performance of a Contract </h4>
                <p>
                    Where you transact with us to buy a product we will use your personal information so that we can
                    fulfil our part of the contract e.g. to deliver the product to you, to take payment and to manage
                    this process.
                </p>

                <h4 class="fw-bolder text-dark">Required by Law </h4>
                <p>
                    We will, if required by law, disclose your personal information for example in response to a court
                    order. We will disclose your personal information if requested by a law enforcement agency or where
                    we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
                    suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,
                    non-compliance with of our terms and conditions, or as otherwise permitted or required by law and
                    consistent with legal requirements.

                    necessary to enable them to perform their services or function. We will also always ensure that
                    before we share your personal information with a service provider, we have entered into a contract
                    with the service provider which requires them to keep your information secure and only use it for
                    the purposes we permit them to. We will never sell or share your personal information with third
                    parties for the purposes of marketing without seeking prior consent.

                <h3 class="fw-bolder text-dark">How Long We Will Keep Your Personal Information For

                <p>
                    We will keep your personal information for as long as we need it to provide the services and

                    complaints and to enforce our rights. As a result, the length of time that we keep your information
                    for will vary depending on the purposes for which we have it. In any event, we will review what
                    information we need on an ongoing basis and will only retain it for the minimum amount of time that
                    we need it for.

                    Your personal information may occasionally be processed and held by third parties outside the
                    European Economic Area (EEA). Whereas in the EU, we implement a high standard of data protection
                    law, some parts of the world do not implement such stringent laws. As a result, if we do send
                    personal information overseas we will make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure
                    it is protected in accordance with European data protection law. These might include: –
